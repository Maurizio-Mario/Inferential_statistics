The exponential distribution can be simulated in R with rexp(n, lambda) where lambda is the rate parameter. The mean of exponential distribution is 1/lambda and the standard deviation is also 1/lambda. Set lambda = 0.2 for all of the simulations. You will investigate the distribution of averages of 40 exponentials. Note that you will need to do a thousand simulations._\n\nIllustrate via simulation and associated explanatory text the properties of the distribution of the mean of 40 exponentials. \n\n## Simulations\n_Include English explanations of the simulations you ran, with the accompanying R code._\n\nSet `lambda` to 0.2.\n\n```{r}\nlambda <- 0.2\n```\n\nI create a first data object `dt1` with a vectorized operation. When possible, I prefer this approach rather than a loop function. I set `set.seed(123)`. \n\n```{r}\nset.seed(123)\ndt1 <- replicate(1000, mean(rexp(40, lambda)))\n```\n\nNote that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.\n\n## Sample Mean versus Theoretical Mean \n_Include figures with titles. In the figures, highlight the means you are comparing. Include text that explains the figures and what is shown on them, and provides appropriate numbers._\n\nThe sample mean is not very distant from the theoretical mean.\n\n```{r}\ns_mean <- mean(dt1)\nth_mean <- 1/lambda\ns_mean\nth_mean\n```\n\nNow I am going to graphically compare the distribution of data `dt1` abouth the means.\n\n```{r show hist and means}\nhist(dt1)\n```\n\nSample Variance versus Theoretical Variance: Include figures (output from R) with titles. Highlight the variances you are comparing. Include text that explains your understanding of the differences of the variances.\nDistribution: Via figures and text, explain how one can tell the distribution is approximately normal.\n",
