The exponential distribution can be simulated in R with rexp(n, lambda) where lambda is the rate parameter. The mean of exponential distribution is 1/lambda and the standard deviation is also 1/lambda. Set lambda = 0.2 for all of the simulations. You will investigate the distribution of averages of 40 exponentials. Note that you will need to do a thousand simulations._\n\nIllustrate via simulation and associated explanatory text the properties of the distribution of the mean of 40 exponentials. \n\n## Simulations\n_Include English explanations of the simulations you ran, with the accompanying R code._\n\nSet `lambda` to 0.2.\n\n```{r}\nlambda <- 0.2\n```\n\nI create a first data object `dt1` with a vectorized operation. When possible, I prefer this approach rather than a loop function. I set `set.seed(123)`. \n\n```{r}\nset.seed(123)\ndt1 <- replicate(1000, mean(rexp(40, lambda)))\nclass(dt1)\n```\n\n## Sample Mean versus Theoretical Mean \n_Include figures with titles. In the figures, highlight the means you are comparing. Include text that explains the figures and what is shown on them, and provides appropriate numbers._\n\nThe sample mean is not very distant from the theoretical mean.\n\n```{r}\ns_mean <- mean(dt1)\nth_mean <- 1/lambda\ns_mean\nth_mean\n```\n\nNow I am going to graphically compare the distribution of data `dt1` abouth the means.\n\n```{r show hist and means}\nhist(dt1, main = \"Simulation means frequencies\", col = \"lightgray\")\nabline(v = s_mean, col = \"green\")\nabline(v = th_mean, col = \"red\")\n```\n\nAs anticipated after the calculation of the means, the deffirence between the sample mean and the theoretical mean is not relevant. \n\n## Sample Variance versus Theoretical Variance\n_Include figures (output from R) with titles. Highlight the variances you are comparing. Include text that explains your understanding of the differences of the variances._\n\nComparison between sample variance and theoretical variance.\n\n```{r variance}\ns_var <- var(dt1)\nth_var <- ((1/lambda)^2)/40\ns_var\nth_var\n```\n\n## Distribution\n_Via figures and text, explain how one can tell the distribution is approximately normal._\n\nAs anticipated, variance and theoretical variance do not differ that much, hence variability is similar between to a normal distribution. That is maily due to the Central Limit Theorem. You can approximate the sampleâ€™s distribution with a normal distribution if the sample size is large enough.\n\n```{r distribution, fig.height = 5}\n# Add normal distribution line to hist\n\npar(mfrow = c(1, 2))\nh2 <- hist(dt1, col=\"lightgray\", main=\"Normal distribution curve\") \nxfit<-seq(min(dt1),max(dt1),length=40) \nyfit<-dnorm(xfit,mean=mean(dt1),sd=sd(dt1)) \nyfit <- yfit*diff(dt1[1:2])*length(dt1) \nlines(xfit, yfit, col=\"red\", lwd=2)\n\nh1 <- hist(dt1, probability = TRUE, col = \"lightgray\", main = \"Probability density curve\")\nlines(density(dt1), col = \"red\", lwd = 2)\n```\n\n",
